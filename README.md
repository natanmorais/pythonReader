# pythonReader

### What is it?
pythonReader is a tool that reads CSV files and convert it into a JSON, using email as the primary key for each person.

### How to use it?
Download or Clone the code, and run the Main.py file.
The console will ask for the full path of the file you want to read and convert.

### How to test it?
To run the unit tests designed for the code it is necessary to run the TestReader.py.
But before that, check if the constant <b>PATH</b> is showing the directory where your files are.
To perform the test it is necessary to have 4 different files, 1 containing the right data, and other 3 containing errors of emails, genders and birthdays.
They're all in the same path, but their names have a different sufixe, showing what is the error about.
